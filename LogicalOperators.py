# logical operators help you build logic in a program even further
# what if you want to combine some booleans
# we have an and operator, or operator and a not operator we can use them wisely

# now lets see what  logical operators do
# and (both have to be true and the result will be true)
print(True and True)
print(False and True)
print(False and False)
# or operators, one of them have to be true then the result will be true
print(True or False)
print(False or False)
# not operator inverts the result, if it is False it gives true and vice versa
print(not (True))
# Now lets use them in real programming
